            <h3>üßÇ How Much Salt Per Day Is Healthy?</h3>
            <p>Salt‚Äîessential to life, but too much of it can have serious health consequences. With processed foods and takeout meals on the rise, understanding how much salt we actually need (and how much we‚Äôre consuming) is more important than ever.
Let‚Äôs break it down.<br>

üß† How Much Salt Does the Body Need?
Salt is made up of sodium and chloride‚Äîtwo essential minerals your body needs to:
‚Ä∫  Regulate fluid balance
‚Ä∫  Support nerve function
‚Ä∫  Aid muscle contractions
However, most people consume far more salt than necessary, especially through processed foods and restaurant meals.
Zoom into Fact: Sodium is the part of salt that impacts blood pressure. Just 1 gram of salt contains about 400 mg of sodium.<br>

üßÆ Recommended Daily Intake by Age
Health organizations worldwide offer similar recommendations:
Group Daily Sodium Limit Equivalent Salt (approx.)
Adults (18+) less then 2,300 mg sodium ~6 grams of salt
Ideal Limit (Heart Health) 1,500 mg sodium ~4 grams of salt
Children (1‚Äì13 yrs) 1,200‚Äì2,000 mg sodium ~3‚Äì5 grams of salt
People with Hypertension 1,500 mg sodium or less ~4 grams of salt
ü©∫ WHO, CDC, and the American Heart Association all recommend staying under 2,300 mg/day‚Äîand ideally aiming for 1,500 mg.<br>
________________________________________<br>
üö© Signs You're Eating Too Much Salt
‚Ä∫  Frequent headaches
‚Ä∫  High blood pressure
‚Ä∫  Bloating or swelling
‚Ä∫  Thirst or dry mouth
‚Ä∫  Difficulty sleeping
‚Ä∫  Kidney strain (in severe cases)
It‚Äôs not just about what you add with a salt shaker‚Äî75% of sodium comes from packaged and restaurant foods.

üçΩÔ∏è Tips to Reduce Salt Intake
1. Read Nutrition Labels
Look for products labeled ‚Äúlow sodium‚Äù (under 140 mg/serving).
2. Cook More at Home
This gives you control over ingredients.
3. Use Herbs & Spices Instead of Salt
Garlic, cumin, pepper, and vinegar are great flavor enhancers.
4. Watch Out for ‚ÄúHidden Salt‚Äù
Bread, sauces, and deli meats are often surprisingly salty.
5. Choose Fresh Over Processed
Fresh meats and vegetables have far less sodium than their canned or packaged versions.
